- we assembled the bottom of the box, and taped it along the center and the edges to gain stability and avoid scattering light from the bottom
- we integrated a wooden board on the bottom of the box and taped the second bottom wings of the packages to the side so that the wodden board gets more stability and so that it does not distract the camera sensor
- the wooden board helps that the camera is always even (with card board there is always a bit of variance)
- we calculated (pi times thumb) the center of the bottom and taped the camera sensor with double-sided tape
- we taped over the IR camera because it projected a lot of white dots onto the plexis glas which were reflected and resulted in distractions for the camera
